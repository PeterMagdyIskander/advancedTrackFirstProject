# MyReads Project
This project project is a liberary of all the books i have, which are sorted according to the state of the book, some books might be read, others are being read, and some i'll one day read


## Usage
this website is made to keep track of all the books i have, since it might be hard to manage which books i am reading, and which i am not

## Updates to come
I migh also add a bookmark functionality to know what page i am in in which book

## To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

The backend server was provided to me by the course makers and it is divided into 3 mail functionalities.


* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

getAll brings all the books in my lierary

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

update takes a book and a book shelf in the parameters to update the state of this book

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`
search which searches the list of all books not from my liberary but from another server, and i can later use the returned books to add to my liberary

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.
